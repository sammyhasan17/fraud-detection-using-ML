# 🚧 Credit Card Fraud Detection 🚧  

## ✅ Model Built — Currently in Testing & Validation  

### Developed a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using **1.3M real-world banking transactions**.  
Specifically built with **Ensemble Learning using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting).**  

---

## 📌 What is Ensemble Learning?  
Instead of training one “super-model,” we train **many weaker models** and combine them.  
This improves accuracy, reduces overfitting, and helps the system adapt to **fraud patterns it hasn’t seen before.**

---

## 💡 Why does it make sense for this project?  
1. It **reduces overfitting** — helping the model detect new fraud patterns it has never seen.  
2. The **ensemble model can learn effectively from limited fraud examples** — by focusing on the mistakes made in previous rounds, it gradually improves its ability to identify rare cases.  

---

# 🔜 NEXT STEPS  
- **Validate against overfitting** with stricter tests.  
- **Compare with other approaches** (Random Forest, LightGBM, Deep Learning).  
- **Fine-tune thresholds & metrics** (Precision/Recall, PR-AUC).  

Stay tuned for results!!
