# ðŸš§ Credit Card Fraud Detection (WIP)

## Currently in Progress 
 
### Building a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using 1.3M real-world banking transactions.

specifically using Ensemble learning with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

What is ensemble learning and WHY use it?

# What is ensemble learning?
Instead of training 1 super accurate model (like a Neural Network), we will train a large number of low accuracy models and then combine them to achieve high accuracy

# Why does it make sense for this project?

1. it reduces overfittingâ€”helping the model detect new fraud patterns it has never seen
2. the enememble model can learn effectively from the limited fraud examples - this is due to focusing on the mistakes made in previous examples, gradually improving its ability to identify rare cases

Stay tuned for updates!
